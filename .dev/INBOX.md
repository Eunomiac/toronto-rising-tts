2026-06-27 TOR-281 — Stage Clear seat activation rules + live scene-library seat persistence (promoted; NPC & Spotlight, parent TOR-35; relatedTo TOR-250/TOR-178/TOR-265/TOR-244; Medium)
2026-06-27 Storyteller advantages panel — shipped TOR-279 (Storyteller Stats panel); removed stale Active marker
2026-06-27 Scene-switch weather fade-in regression — weather started at full volume instead of fading. Two causes: (1) staged scene Apply work-phase `Sync.full` did not pass `skipSoundscape`, letting a work-phase reconcile re-apply weather via the immediate held-volume path outside the fade window; (2) `Soundscape.reapplyWeatherNaturalVolumes` (called by `applyContext` → `setIndoors`) snapped the still-playing weather emitter to full before the layers faded in. Fix: work sync now skips soundscape (fadeIn is sole authority, matching no-scene path); `reapplyWeatherNaturalVolumes` ramps via `fadeEmitterVolume` when a transition fade window is open (TOR-280; relatedTo TOR-147, TOR-270, TOR-136)
2026-06-27 Map pins on scene change — present PCs show immediately (clock gate `< 0`); absent PCs keep prior pin across scenes (`lastActiveMapPin` moved to top-level gameState, was wiped by sessionScene replace on apply)
2026-06-27 RT clock acceleration on scene change — epoch guard in game_state_overlay ticker so stale Wait callbacks can't spawn duplicate tick chains
2026-06-27 Scene transition sound timing — new-location ambient fade-in now starts as the blindfold RISES (concurrent with lift, ~2s `TRANSITION_FADE_IN_SEC`); blindfold holds down silently for the full settle (`settleDelaySec - workSettleSec`) then lifts via `scheduleEnd(0)` in runStagedTransition (TOR-273 follow-up; supersedes earlier "deferred to end of settle" approach)
2026-06-27 Overlay management — blindfold variants 1..22 randomization (BLINDFOLD_VARIANT_COUNT was 6); removed impaired-willpower + torpor HUD overlays; added derived `stained` overlay (Humanity stains ≥ 1)
