# Running Tasklist for Storyteller Dashboard Work



## Agent Instructions

This file is the progress tracker for Storyteller Dashboard work. **Do not create, update, or comment on Linear issues for this slice.** Review this file periodically to check for new instructions from the author. They will be presented in bullet-point form.



- Once you have completed an item, mark it with a '✔️' emoji at the front.

- If you need clarification or cannot perform a task, add a line directly beneath the relevant item, prefixed with a '🤖' emoji

- Author comments or responses will be prefixed with a '👨' emoji

- Deferred tasks prefixed with a '⏳' emoji should be skipped until that emoji is removed.

- Completed & approved issues will be deleted from this running task list by the author.

- Incomplete, incorrect, or issues that otherwise deserve more attention will be flagged with a '❌', followed by a '👨'-flagged comment describing the issue

**Note:** You have full authority to make changes to settings and imports on the app while testing -- none of the data is important to retain at this point in testing. (E.g. you shouldn't hesitate to move tokens around, even tokens that were placed by me, or make changes to the top controls to test things.)

## General Guidelines

1. I'd like to see more creativity in how you design the various control elements. District, Site and Skybox could be combined into a rectangular widget with buttons to change each; date controls could be condensed into an interesting and well-designed time control widget; weather controls could be contained in a weather-report style widget where various icons can be clicked to toggle through weather states, separating Rain, Snow, Wind, and Thunder into different controls that can be changed independently of each other. Lighting and top fog could also be incorporated into this widget, or perhaps a different one.  Consider checking sites like codepen, Pinterest, StackOverflow, Reddit -- those may be terrible examples, you may know of better sites to look at for UX inspiration, but I think we can do better and you should feel free to experiment with new ideas, see for yourself how they work, and then refine them or reject them and try something new. Feel free to create a planning document specific to these sorts of UX-improvement experiments, to keep track of your work and slowly build up a catalog of what is and isn't effective. **Important:** All issues described below should be considered with this in mind: If instructions there conflict with changes you've made to the functionality a later issue deals with, simply skip it and add a 🤖-comment requesting clarification on how things should work given your new design.

🤖 Experiment log: `.dev/storyteller-dashboard/agent/UX Experiments.md`. First chrome pass is on the right rail (place / clock / weather) with group trays on the left.

2. Generally speaking, avoid using emojis as icons -- prefer using icons from game-icons.net, as they are much more resilient in terms of font and other styling peculiarities.

## Task List

✔️ SD-13.6. The positions and alignments for all token names are now recorded in `.dev\storyteller-dashboard\agent\Token Name Offsets.json`

✔️ SD-31. Vary the red background color on the weather controls by intensity, as well as duplicating the icons: Low intensity should be darker red, increasing to full #FF0000 at maximum intensity.  The Wind button should get a cyan outline (not a border, to avoid repositioning) when it is applying winter wind instead of standard wind.
👨 Use these colors for maximum distinctiveness:  #220000, #660000, #FF0000

SD-32. Tokens (and their labels) should be z-ordered according to their vertical position:  The closer a token is to the bottom of the screen, the higher its z-index should be (i.e. lower tokens should overlap tokens higher up on the y-axis)
