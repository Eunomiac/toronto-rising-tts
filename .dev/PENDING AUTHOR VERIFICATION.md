# Pending Author Verification

Your TTS checklist for shipped work that still needs Save & Play / in-game confirmation. Issues listed here should be **Awaiting Author Review** in Linear.

**Marks** (prefix the `####` header):

| Mark | Who | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **✅** | Author | Confirmed in TTS — agents remove on next inbox |
| **❌** | Author | Still broken (+ **Author Comment:**) |
| **⚠️** | Author | Bad expectations (+ **Author Comment:**) |
| **⏰** | Agent | Not ready to verify yet — fix is open in Linear / Focus; **do not** Save & Play for this row until the watch is cleared |
| **🚫** | Author | Irrelevant or obsolete - feature being tested is to be replaced by the Storyteller Dashboard; follow-up validation of this issue can be discarded (see **Author Comment**s for more details on how to handle the Linear issue) |

Unmarked = shipped (or verification gate) and waiting for your first pass. Agents add a new unmarked row and set Linear to **Awaiting Author Review** whenever they ship in-game code. They process your **✅** / **❌** / **⚠️** marks on the next inbox. A **✅** moves the Linear issue to **Fully Complete** by default, or **Complete (KEEP)** when its Linear history should be retained. Agent policy: [PENDING AUTHOR VERIFICATION.agent.md](PENDING AUTHOR VERIFICATION.agent.md).

## Outstanding

_Last populated: 2026-10-02 — TOR-642 confirmed and removed; TOR-645 (experience log reset) added._

### Character sheets

#### TOR-645 — Experience log returns to the top when page 6 is turned away

**How to verify:** Save & Play so the new scripts load. Sit a character whose experience log has more than one page (use the chevrons on page 6 until you are looking at an older session, not the newest one at the top).

1. Turn the sheet forward from page 6, or back from page 5, so pages 5 and 6 leave the table.
2. Turn back to pages 5 and 6.
3. Page 6 should show the newest session at the top again, with the older-session chevron available if there is more than one page. It should not still be sitting on the older page you had open.

**Context:** The log remembered `xpLogPage` after the page was parked. Hiding page 6 now sets that back to page 1 and repaints the listing. The check uses the page being moved, so both the forward button on page 6 and the back button on page 5 count.

### High — session / join / first-load

#### ⏰ TOR-439 — Join-stress re-verify after Global HUD remount weight cut

**Status:** Linear **In Progress** (verification gate; code already shipped). Needs other people at the table — not a solo Save & Play.

**How to verify:** Run the multiclient control/treatment playbook in [TOR-439-join-xml-spike-verify.md](Step-By-Step Playbooks/TOR-439-join-xml-spike-verify.md). On the Host, arm the minimal join XML, have the struggling client connect, then restore in stages. Especially watch **step 2 (HUD / Refresh UI)** after the **TOR-444** remount-weight reduction: does that client stay connected through the full Global HUD remount? Optionally also try a normal (unarmed) full-HUD join to see whether the Arm pipeline is still needed at all.

**Context:** Earlier run: Assets, Emitters, and Figurines restore steps succeeded; step 2 timed out and drove **TOR-444**. Deferred from Focus until you can gather testers.

## Cleared

_Remove confirmed entries from Outstanding. In Linear, set **Fully Complete** by default; use **Complete (KEEP)** sparingly when the issue contains lasting information that should remain._
