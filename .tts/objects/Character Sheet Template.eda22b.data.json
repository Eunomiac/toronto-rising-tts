  "LuaScript": "--[[    Character Sheet Template    by: MrStump\r\n\r\nYou can set up your own character sheet if you follow these steps.\r\n\r\nStep 1) Change the character sheet image\r\n    -Right click on the character sheet, click Custom\r\n    -Replace the image URL with one for your character sheet\r\n    -Click import, make sure your sheet loads\r\n    -SAVE THE GAME (the table setup)\r\n    -LOAD FROM THAT SAVE YOU JUST MADE\r\n\r\nStep 2) Edit script to fit your character sheet\r\n    -Below you will see some general options, and then the big data table\r\n    -The data table is what determines how many of which buttons are made\r\n        -Checkboxes\r\n        -Counters\r\n        -Textboxes\r\n    -By default, there are 3 of each. You can add more or remove entries\r\n    -If you intend to add/remove, be sure only to add/remove ENTRIES\r\n        -This is what an entry looks like:\r\n            {\r\n                pos   = {-0.977,0.1,-0.589},\r\n                size  = 800,\r\n                state = false\r\n            },\r\n        -Deleting the whole thing would remove that specific item on the sheet\r\n        -Copy and pasting it after another entry would create another\r\n    -Each entry type has unique data points (pos, size, state, etc)\r\n        -Do not try to add in your own data points or remove them individually\r\n        -There is a summary of what each point does at the top of its category\r\n\r\nStep 3) Save and check script changes\r\n    -Hit Save & Apply in the script window to save your code\r\n    -You can edit your code as needed and Save+Apply as often as needed\r\n    -When you are finished, make disableSave = false below then Save+apply\r\n        -This enables saving, so your sheet will remember whats on it.\r\n\r\nBonus) Finding/Editing Positions for elements\r\n    I have included a tool to get positions for buttons in {x,y,z} form\r\n    Place it where you want the center of your element to be\r\n    Then copy the table from the notes (lower right of screen)\r\n        You can highlight it and CTRL+C\r\n    Paste it into the data table where needed (pos=)\r\n    If you want to manually tweek the values:\r\n        {0,0,0} is the center of the character sheet\r\n        {1,0,0} is right, {-1,0,0} is left\r\n        {0,0,-1} is up, {0,0,1} is down\r\n        0.1 for Y is the height off of the page.\r\n            If it was 0, it would be down inside the model of the sheet\r\n\r\nBegin editing below:    ]]\r\n\n--Set this to true to disable automatic update of\n--health and willpower trackers based on attributes\ndisableUpdateTrackers = false\n\n--Set this to an integer value to modify your maximum health and willpower tracker\nmaxhealthmod = 0\nmaxwillpowermod = 0\n\r\n--Set this to true while editing and false when you have finished\r\ndisableSave = false\r\n--Remember to set this to false once you are done making changes\r\n--Then, after you save & apply it, save your game too\r\n\r\n--Color information for button text (r,g,b, values of 0-1)\r\nbuttonFontColor = {0,0,0}\r\n--Color information for button background\r\nbuttonColor = {1,1,1}\r\n--Change scale of button (Avoid changing if possible)\r\nbuttonScale = {0.1,0.1,0.1}\r\n\r\n--This is the button placement information\r\ndefaultButtonData = {\r\n    --Add checkboxes\r\n
